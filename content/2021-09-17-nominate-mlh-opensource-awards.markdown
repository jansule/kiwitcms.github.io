Last year Kiwi TCMS started
[partnering]({filename}2020-10-13-partnership-mlh-fellowship.markdown)
with the MLH Fellowship open source program. During the span of 3 semesters
fellows received mentorship and career advice from us. They were also able
to work on
[20+ issues](https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22MLH+Fellowship%22)
the majority of which have been complete.

For that we kindly ask the open source community to nominate Kiwi TCMS at the
[MLH Open Source Awards](https://fellowship.mlh.io/opensourceawards).


*Steps to reproduce:*

1. Go to <https://fellowship.mlh.io/opensourceawards>
2. Click the **Submit a Nomination** button
3. Follow the instructions on screen!


*Expected results:*

1. It should take you 2 minutes
2. Your submission is recorded by MLH


Why are we doing this
---------------------

MLH is recognizing extraordinary open source projects and communities. It is up to you,
our community members and the general public to decide whether Kiwi TCMS qualifies
or not. Winning this award will let us show what we do before a larger audience!


Thank you for supporting Kiwi TCMS and happy testing!
