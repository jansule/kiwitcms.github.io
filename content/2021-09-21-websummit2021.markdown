Kiwi TCMS is happy to announce that our first post-COVID live presence
will be at [WebSummit 2021](https://websummit.com/), Nov 1-4 in Lisbon, Portugal.
We're joining as a [featured startup](https://websummit.com/startups/featured-startups)
as part of the ALPHA program in category *Enterprise Software Solutions*.

Kiwi TCMS will have an on-site presence during the exhibition (1 day) where you can
easily find us. We've also applied to the
[Startup Showcase](https://websummit.com/startups/startup-showcase) track where you can
see Alex present on stage. In addition, if all goes
well our team will be joined by Alexandre Neto of QCooperative who is leading
the effort to adopt Kiwi TCMS for testing the QGIS open source project. More on that
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wob_L_SrEwE).


Exact schedules are still unknown at this stage so you will have to ping us via email/Twitter
or find us on the conference floor if you want to meet.

Below is our video submission to the organizers:
