Hello testers,
this blog post outlines Kiwi TCMS roadmap for 2021 and what we feel is
important to us!

Project sustainability
======================

The big goal towards which we are striving is to turn Kiwi TCMS into a
sustainable open source project. For now this means three key areas:

    1) Team
    2) Technical
    3) Community & Adoption

Team
----

Right now we have a core team with 3 members, 3 more members on-boarding
and 2 interns. In the past year we weren't successful into turning more
people into core-team members.
I have seen several problems and core-team will significantly reconsider
how we approach & recruit people to join the team, how we on-board and help
them so that they can become productive and fully fledged team members.

Long term focus is improving and strengthening core-team which also implies
a level of responsibility and performance criteria which core-team members
must meet.

**Goal:** 1 PR/week/person as broad measure of individual performance so that
we can operate with a predictable capacity.

**Goal:** (re)structure internal team processes around candidates and newcomers!
Note: These are not public at the moment.


Technical
---------

The areas shown on the picture above will receive more priority.

**Goal:** complete remaining [Telemetry features]({filename}2019-03-03-telemetry.markdown).

**Goal:** complete remaining refactoring with major focus in pylint issues, migration to
Patternfly v4 and eslint issues.

**Goal:** improve SSL configuration with strong bias towards Let's Encrypt being
configured by default.

**Goal:** provide support for web hooks so that Kiwi TCMS can be integrated more
easily/flexibly with 3rd party systems. We're aiming for Kiwi TCMS to be able to
POST webhooks to external URLs and inform them about events in the system.

Community & Adoption
--------------------

Last year Kiwi TCMS had massive success despite not visiting many events. The
open source community spirit is important to us both in terms of technical
collaborations and in terms of features & exposure which drives further adoption
of Kiwi TCMS downstream.

**Goal:** complete
[bug-tracker integration milestone](https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/milestone/1).


**Goal:** extended GitHub integration via GitHub actions which will report results
into our database. We do have other ideas as stretch goals.

**Goal:** similar to GitHub actions we're looking towards GitLab pipelines and
similar integration with GitLab.

**Goal:** continue our collaboration with Major League Hacking Fellowship program.

**Goal:** apply for the Google Summer of Code program and work with students if selected.
