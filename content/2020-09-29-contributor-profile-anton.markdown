What is your professional background
------------------------------------

I started programming while in university and haven't stopped since.

I have experience in different technologies like Java, Spring, Go and of course, Python.
I have grown acustomed to switching languages and using what fits the job best.

Currently I am a Member of Technical Staff at [VMware Carbon Black](https://www.carbonblack.com/),
where I work towards making the world a safer place from cyber attacks with a multi-cultural team of awesome people.


When did you use open source for the first time
-----------------------------------------------

I suppose I've been using open source software since I own a computer.
The first time I realised what open source is, was when I started my first job,
had to fix a bug in our system, and in the end it turned out that the problem was in a library
we were using. So the fix involved making an upstream contribution.


Describe your contributions to the project
------------------------------------------

I started working on [Kiwi TCMS](https://github.com/kiwitcms/kiwi/) will small contributions,
like bug fixes, small refactorings, pylint fixes and writing tests.
Once I got more comfortable with the project, I started working on bigger things like
refactoring the major pages of the UI to Patternfly,
building the new [Telemetry](https://kiwitcms.org/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2019/03/03/legacy-reports-become-telemetry/) pages from scratch
and fixing bigger bugs reported by our customers.
Also, since the team started growing, I participate in the process of onboarding and training the new team members.


Why did you decide to contribute to Kiwi TCMS
---------------------------------------------

I knew Alex from before, and he recruited me to help with the new project he had started.
I had just completed an intership, so I had the free time and decided that the experience would benefit me.
Two and a half years later, the reasons to contribute has changed, but the motivation stays the same.


Was there something which was hard for you during the contribution process
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I had little prior experience with Python and no expirience with Django.
I had to find my way in a legacy project, built with technologies I don't understand so well.
However, we live in the time of Stack Overflow and YouTube, so this was the easier challenge.
What I still find hard is understanding all the different ways people do testing and use our software.


Which is the best part of contributing to Kiwi TCMS
---------------------------------------------------

Making my skill valuable to the community, and doing actual work to gain more experience and improve my skillset.


What is next for you in professional and open source plan
---------------------------------------------------------

Open source is everywhere, and it is up to us to make open source better.
When I use an open source project, be it a library, a tool, or a script,
I always try to improve it and give back to the maintainers in some way -
sometimes with an issues, other times with a pull request, or a donation.

I want to continue improving the open source landscape and making more contributions
to the tools I use in my day-to-day work.
