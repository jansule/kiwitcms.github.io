        <div class="content">
            <p>Hello everyone, in this article I will outline the progress that the Kiwi TCMS
team has made towards achieving the goals in our 2018
<a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2018/01/22/kiwi-tcms-roadmap-for-2018/">roadmap</a>
(<a href="/blog/atodorov/2018/07/25/mid-year-roadmap-status-report/">mid-year update here</a>).
TLDR; goals are completed at 62%. Refactoring legacy code is showing good results,
less so on the front-end side and there are items still in progress!</p>
<h2>Make code easier to maintain</h2>
<p><em>Status: good progress</em></p>
<p>Initially <a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">CodeClimate</a> reported
a "D" rating with 600+ code smells and 600+ duplications and a 1 year estimation
to resolve these. We're now down to "C" rating with 171 smells and 203 duplications.</p>
<p>The level of technical debt has dropped from 32.5% down to 17.7% and we have removed
around 14000 lines of Python code and 8000 lines of JavaScript code without
losing significant functionality.</p>
<p>Checkout
<a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi/trends/technical_debt">the stats</a>
for more info!</p>
<h2>Use pylint and pylint-django</h2>
<p><em>Status: almost finished</em></p>
<p>Both pylint and pylint-django have been integrated into our CI workflow. There are even
some custom built plugins that we use. The number of issues reported is down to 100
from 4000+ initially. These are predominantly <code>fixme</code> comments which are also in parts
of the code that are scheduled for removal and refactoring.</p>
<h2>Render HTML, return JSON</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>Several views were modified to return pure JSON but we've not
done any targeted work to resolve this issue. A number of other views have been
removed in favor of using the existing JSON-RPC layer.</p>
<p>This is an internal refactoring effort which isn't very visible from the outside.
This is also one of the factors contributing to the high number of removed
source code.</p>
<h2>Submit forms, post JSON, GET clean URLs</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Not much has been done in this area except the occasional refactoring to
JSON-RPC.</p>
<h2>API layer</h2>
<p><em>Status: complete</em></p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress, dropped</em></p>
<p>All RPC methods have been documented! The rest of the internals will be documented
as we go along.</p>
<h2>No vendored JavaScript libraries</h2>
<p><em>Status: good progress</em></p>
<p>We still carry around jQuery, jQuery-UI and Handlebars.js. They will be
removed once the pages using them are converted to use the Patternfly widgets
library.</p>
<h2>Less HTML templates with better organization</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>There are still over 50 HTML templates in <code>tcms/templates/</code> that need to be
refactored into Patternfly. We've been working on them one at a time and will
focus more on this effort in the next couple of months.</p>
<h2>Modern interface with Patternfly</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>Some of the pages have been converted to use Patternfly. The most important pages
that still have a different look and feel are TestPlan view, TestCase view and
TestRun view. These are also the hardest to convert because they have lots of
tabs/components which pull information from various places. Our goal is to create
reusable widgets for the various components (e.g. a list of TestCases) and then
include these components into several different templates to minimize code
duplication.</p>
<h2>JavaScript updates and front-end testing</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>A number of JavaScript functions have been refactored and removed during the
past few releases but there are still thousands of lines of code left to deal with.
This effort is mostly happening in parallel with the Patternfly redesign.
We still don't have anything to test front-end JavaScript functionality!</p>
<h2>Community efforts</h2>
<p><em>Status: good progress</em></p>
<p>We are seeing a steady stream of new users registered on
<a href="https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org/login/github-app/">https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org</a> and
there are several active contributors on GitHub. Most of our translators are
very active and keep their respective languages fresh and up to date!</p>
<p>Kiwi TCMS was represented at OSCAL Tirana, DjangoCon Heidelberg, PyCon Prague,
HackConf Sofia, PiterPy St. Petersburg and OpenFest Sofia. We've also been
approved for a project stand at FOSDEM 2019 so watch this blog for more news.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

                    <a href="/blog/atodorov/">Alexander Todorov</a>
                on Fri 12 October 2018
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>I am happy to announce that <a href="/team/">our team</a> is steadily growing!
As we work through our <a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2018/01/22/kiwi-tcms-roadmap-for-2018/">roadmap</a>,
<a href="/blog/atodorov/2018/07/25/mid-year-roadmap-status-report/">status update here</a>, and
on-board new team members I start to feel the need for a bit more structure
and organization behind the scenes. I also wish for consistent contributions
to the project (commit early, commit often) so I can better estimate the resources
that we have!</p>
<p>I am also actively discussing Kiwi TCMS with lots of people at various conferences
and generate many ideas for the future. The latest SEETEST in Belgrade was particularly
fruitful. Some of these ideas are pulling into different directions and I need help
to keep them under control!</p>
<p>Development-wise sometimes I lose track of what's going on and who's doing what between
working on Kiwi TCMS, preparing for conferences and venues to promote the project,
doing code review of other team members, trying not to forget to check-in on
progress (especially by interns), recruiting fresh blood and thinking about
the overall future of the project. Our user base is growing and there are days
where I feel like everything is happening at once or that something
needs to be implemented ASAP (which is usually true anyway)!</p>
<p><img class="rounded" src="/images/team/rstankova.jpg"></p>
<p>Meet Rayna Stankova in the role of our team coach!
Reny is a director for Women Who Code Sofia, senior QA engineer at VMware,
mentor with CoderDojo Bulgaria and a long-time friend of mine.
Although she is an experienced QA in her own right she will be contributing
to the people side of Kiwi TCMS and less so technically!</p>
<p>Her working areas will be planning and organization:</p>
<ul>
<li>help us (re)define the project vision and goals</li>
<li>work with us on roadmaps and action plans so we can meet
  the project goals faster</li>
<li>help us (self) organize so that we are more efficient,
  including checking progress and blockers (aka enforcer) and
  meet the aforementioned consistency point</li>
<li>serve as our professional coach, motivator and somebody who will
  take care of team health (yes I really suck at motivating others)</li>
</ul>
<p>and generally serving as another very experienced member of the team!</p>
<p>We did a quick brainstorming yesterday and started to produce results
(#smileyface)! We do have a team docs space to share information
(non-public for now, will open it gradually as we grow) and came up
with the idea to use Kiwi TCMS as a check-list for our on-boarding/internship
process!</p>
<p>I don't know how it will play out but I do expect from the
team to self-improve, be inspired, become more focused and more productive!
<strong>All of this also applies to myself, even more so!</strong></p>
<h2>Existing team members progress</h2>
<p>Last year we started with 2 existing team members (Tony and myself) and 3
new interns (Ivo, Kaloyan and Tseko) who built this website!</p>
<p>Tony is the #4 contributor to Kiwi TCMS in
terms of <a href="https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/graphs/contributors">number of commits</a>
and is on track to surpass one of the original authors (before Kiwi TCMS was forked)!
He's been working mostly on internal refactoring and resolving the thousands
of pylint errors that we had (down to around 500 I think). This summer Tony and I
visited the OSCAL conference in Tirana and hosted an info booth for the project.</p>
<p>Ivo is the #5 contributor in terms of numbers of commits. He did learn very
quickly and is working on getting rid of the remaining pylint errors. His ability
to adapt and learn is quite impressive actually. Last month he co-hosted a
git workshop at HackConf, a 1000+ people IT event in Sofia.</p>
<p>Kaloyan did most of the work on our website initially (IIRC).
Now he is studying in the Netherlands
and not active on the project. We are working to reboot his on-boarding
and I'm hoping he will find the time to contribute to Kiwi TCMS regularly.</p>
<p>From the starting team only Tseko decided to move on to other ventures after
he contributed to the website.</p>
<h2>Internship program</h2>
<p>At Kiwi TCMS we have a set of training
programs that teach all the necessary technical skills before we let anyone
actively work on the project, let alone become a team member.</p>
<p>Our new interns are Denitsa Uzunova and Desislava Koleva. Both of them are
coming from Vratsa Software Community and were mentors at the recently held
CodeWeek hackathon in their home city! I wish them fast learning and good luck!</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, in this article I will outline the progress that the Kiwi TCMS
team has made towards achieving the goals on our
<a href="/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2018/01/22/kiwi-tcms-roadmap-for-2018/">roadmap</a>.</p>
<h2>Make code easier to maintain</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>Initially <a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">CodeClimate</a> reported
a "D" rating with a 1 year estimated effort. Now it is still on "D" rating with
a 7 months estimated effort to bring the project back in shape.
Code smells have dropped from 600+ to 418, duplications have been reduced from 600+ to 359!
At the same time technical debt ratio has been decreased from 32,5% to 21,6% and
little over 10000 lines of code have been removed from the source code.
Checkout
<a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi/trends/technical_debt">the stats</a>
for more info!</p>
<h2>Use pylint and pylint-django</h2>
<p><em>Status: good progress</em></p>
<p>Both pylint and pylint-django have been integrated into our CI workflow. There are even
a few custom built plugins that we use. The number of issues reported is down to around 900
from 4000+ initially. The cleanup has been lead by <a href="https://github.com/asankov">Anton Sankov</a>
with help from <a href="https://github.com/ivo0126">Ivaylo Ivanov</a> and myself.</p>
<h2>Render HTML, return JSON</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Several views were probably modified to return pure JSON in the meantime but we've not
done any targeted work to resolve this issue.</p>
<h2>Submit forms, post JSON, GET clean URLs</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<p>Same as above, not much has been done in this area.</p>
<h2>API layer</h2>
<p><em>Status: complete</em></p>
<p>After Kiwi TCMS v4.0 the server side API has been reorganized and updated
to follow the model/method names used internally.</p>
<p>After the recent version 5.0 the client side API library has been stripped
to its most basic form so that you can work directly with the responses from
the server.</p>
<p>There is no more duplication and ambiguity in names because there isn't
a lot of code left!</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress, dropped</em></p>
<p>All RPC methods have been documented! The rest of the internals will be documented
as we go along.</p>
<h2>No vendored JavaScript libraries</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>Several JavaScript libraries have been removed but we still carry around jQuery
and Handlebars.js. No work has been done to convert Kiwi TCMS to use the jQuery
version provided with Django.</p>
<h2>Less HTML templates with better organization</h2>
<p><em>Status: minimal progress</em></p>
<p>There are still over 100 HTML templates in Kiwi TCMS. Some of the HTML templates
have been merged together, some email templates have been refactored and marked
as translatable but the majority of them have not been updated for a long time.</p>
<h2>Modern interface with Patternfly</h2>
<p><em>Status: no progress</em></p>
<h2>JavaScript updates and front-end testing</h2>
<p><em>Status: small progress</em></p>
<p>A number of JavaScript functions have been refactored and removed during the
past few releases but there are still thousands of lines of code left to deal with.</p>
<h2>Community efforts</h2>
<p><em>Status: moderate progress</em></p>
<p>We are seeing a steady stream of new users registered on
<a href="https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org/login/github-app/">https://public.tenant.kiwitcms.org</a> and
there are several active contributors (issues, translations).</p>
<p>Kiwi TCMS was represented at OSCAL Tirana, DjangoCon Heidelberg and PyCon Prague!

            </p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Hello everyone. As you know Kiwi TCMS has been around for a while and it has
gone through some big changes in the last year! It started as an abandoned
Django 1.6 project with broken test suite and is now currently running on the
latest Django 2.0.1 with Python 3.5! It is clearly a legacy code base!</p>
<p>We, the Kiwi TCMS team, have learned a lot more about the project and this
blog post describes our roadmap for 2018 in terms of technical work and community
engagement. The general technical direction is cleaner/simpler code,
improved UI/UX and more tests!</p>
<h2>Make code easier to maintain</h2>
<p>The current code is a bunch of very large modules and functions and classes
bundled together. It is also old and sometimes looks like spaghetti code.
<a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/kiwitcms/Kiwi">CodeClimate</a> gives us a "D" rating
for maintainability with a 1 year estimated effort to fix that. There are 600+
code smells and 600+ duplications detected by CodeClimate. Our goal is to get this
number down to zero!</p>
<h2>Use pylint and pylint-django</h2>
<p>pylint is the standard static analyzer for Python and currently it reports over
4000 errors and warnings when executed against Kiwi TCMS. This is a huge number and
it needs to become zero! We've also identified interesting patterns that will
make it into pylint and pylint-django plugins!</p>
<h2>Render HTML, return JSON</h2>
<p>The current state of affairs is a mix and match of everything. There are views that
render HTML, others which return pure JSON, other which return HTML encoded as JSON string
and probably everything in between. Views that render pages need to do just that
and views that are used with AJAX calls from the UI need to return pure JSON!
A lot of these are hiding in plain sight and will come to light when we start
overhauling the user interface.</p>
<h2>Submit forms, post JSON, GET clean URLs</h2>
<p>There are lots of forms in Kiwi TCMS. Sometimes they are submitted by the user and
other times they are serialized and POSTed by some JavaScript code. This isn't
very easy to understand plus this entire home-grown utility code doesn't bring
anything useful to the project. All of these need to be identified and cleaned up.
JavaScript code needs to send or consume JSON, nothing else!</p>
<p>There are also lots of places where Kiwi issues GET requests with a number of
query parameters. Our goal is to minimize these and where possible have the
parameters as part of the Django urls scheme, not as query strings.</p>
<h2>API layer</h2>
<p>The current API module is a bit disorganized. API namespaces don't match the
names of the underlying DB models and the API client classes don't match any
of the other two! The way we pass parameters and what these parameters are
named should match between the client, the RPC method and the underlying model!</p>
<p>In earlier releases we've removed duplicate or similar RPC methods and we
think there are more of these that need our love.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>We've started producing documentation from doc-strings and most of the RPC
methods have such. However it is unformatted and barely readable, sometimes
even inaccurate. Previous releases made progress on this but there's a lot
more to cover.</p>
<p>All RPC methods should be documented first and then the rest of Kiwi's
internals to make development easier!</p>
<h2>No vendored JavaScript libraries</h2>
<p>There are 11 vendored-in JavaScript files that we carry around in Kiwi TCMS.
Most notable are jQuery plus a few addons and Handlebars.js. To the extent possible
our goal is to use jQuery provided by Django or installed via NPM dependencies!</p>
<h2>Less HTML templates with better organization</h2>
<p>There are over 100 HTML templates in Kiwi TCMS. There are also email and even
JavaScript templates. For example there are <code>get_cases.html</code> and <code>get_review_cases.html</code>
which are essentially the same. This is kind of also true for templates used in
new and edit views! Such templates should be unified!</p>
<p>Those JavaScript templates need to be totally gone!</p>
<p>All templates are stuffed together in a single directory and their names
are not very predictable. They need to be split per application and follow
some kind of naming convention.</p>
<h2>Modern interface with Patternfly</h2>
<p>The UI already uses the Patternfly library for some of its widgets. Most notably
the main navigation header. Our goal is for the entire UI to be ported to Patternfly
by updating widgets HTML and CSS where needed.
This will also help clean things up a lot. At the same time we'll be rethinking how
information is organized on screen and how the person interacts with it! Usability
suggestions are very welcome!</p>
<p>This move will also help us get rid of the Handlebars dependency which is now
used for pop-up dialogs.</p>
<h2>JavaScript updates and front-end testing</h2>
<p>There's lots of JavaScript code on the front-end and honestly we don't quite know
what it does or how it is organized. There are also no tests on the front-end
whatsoever!</p>
<p>It is our goal for this to change with the intention to not overdo the JavaScript
part and keep things very minimal. At the moment we're thinking about vanilla jQuery
that will act as a proxy between the browser and the back-end!</p>
<h2>Community efforts</h2>
<p>A year ago hardly anybody knew what Kiwi TCMS was, the project didn't even have
this name, there was 1 active contributor and hardly any users! Now the community
has started to slowly revitalize, we're seeing some contributions from our
junior team members (more on this in another blog post) and also seeing
folks installing and using Kiwi TCMS and reporting interesting bugs and feature
requests around it!</p>
<p>For the upcoming year our goal is to seek active engagement with other open source
projects that could make use of Kiwi TCMS and work with them. Kudos to
openSUSE for being the first
<a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/mentoring/issues/95">to propose such integration</a>!
We're also planning couple of appearances at a few conferences but there's
nothing confirmed yet.</p>
<p>Every other contribution in terms of bug reports, new users and feature requests
is of course welcome but we're very conscious of the fact that there's tons
of work to be done and the team is still very small!</p>
<p>Team wise we'd like to get the existing team members up to speed and tackle
the above tasks with priority. This will also help us introduce bug fixes
and new features more quickly!</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>
